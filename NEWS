Version 0.6.0

* Improve rules and patterns parsing using regex.

* Use JSON database to store built in patterns. All
  the patterns are uploaded at compile time.  See
  data/pattern_defs.json.

Version 0.5.0

* Show program version from VCS.

* Fix tick control. Separate generation delay from game loop.

* Add custom pattern which can be uploaded from a Golly/RLE
  file format.

Version 0.4.0

* Add libcheck for testing.

* Four states for rendering:
  - Dead stable;
  - Dead to alive;
  - Alive to dead;
  - Alive stable.

* Handle keystrokes asynchronously (q/Q, ESC, SPACE, ENTER).

Version 0.3.0

* Add custom rules, following the RLE format (Bx/Sy).
  This format explicitly defines birth (B) and survival
  (S) conditions. For example: B3/S23 is the classic
  Conwayâ€™s rule: born with 3 neighbors, survives
  with 2 or 3.

* Add rule aliases, as conway, highlife, seeds.
  See `conga -L` for the complete list.

* Random number generator with 'drand48_r'.

Version 0.2.0

* Modularize the 'conga.c' script:
  - wrapper: Wrap error-prone functions;
  - utils:   Miscellaneous functions;
  - config:  Parsing command line arguments, settings;
  - grid:    Manage grid creation and neighbors detection;
  - cell:    Game of Life Logic (initialization and evolution);
  - render:  Visual printout of the grid on the terminal (with ANSI codes);
  - conga:   Main game control: start, loop, end.

Version 0.1.0

* Initial version with a working PoC.
