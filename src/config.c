		"A cellular automaton rule defines how cells are born and survive\n"

		"\n"
		"Rules can be specified in one of two ways:\n"
		"\n"
		"1. Named aliases:\n"
		"\n"
		"Common pre-defined rules can be referenced by name. Examples:\n"
		"\n"
		"* conway - Classic Game of Life (B3/S23)\n"
		"  Cells are born with exactly 3 neighbors and\n"
		"  survive with 2 or 3.\n"
		"\n"
		"* highlife - Variant of Conway's rule (B36/S23)\n"
		"  Same as conway but also allows birth with 6 neighbors,\n"
		"  which enables the appearance of replicators.\n"
		"\n"
		"* seeds - Minimalistic explosive rule (B2/S)\n"
		"  All live cells die every generation; dead cells with\n"
		"  exactly 2 neighbors are born.\n"
		"\n"
		"* life34 - Only cells with 3 or 4 neighbors are born\n"
		"  or survive (B34/S34)\n"
		"  This rule is known for its stable behavior, with contained\n"
		"  growth. It eliminates the explosive behavior common in\n"
		"  other variants.\n"
		"\n"
		"* life_without_death - (B3/S012345678)\n"
		"  Once a cell is born, it never dies. Growth is irreversible.\n"
		"\n"
		"* replicator - (B1357/S1357)\n"
		" A rule where every pattern replicates over time. Both birth\n"
		" and survival occur for odd neighbor counts.\n"
		"\n"
		"* day_and_night - (B3678/S34678)\n"
		"  Symmetric under live/dead inversion: same behavior if\n"
		"  0s and 1s are flipped.\n"
		"\n"
		"* anneal - (B4678/S35678)\n"
		"  Tends toward stability or complete activation depending\n"
		"  on initial state.\n"
		"\n"
		"* mazectric - (B3/S1234)\n"
		"  Maze-like patterns with branching behavior.\n"
		"\n"
		"* maze - (B3/S12345)\n"
		"  Tends to grow into complex maze-like structures that freeze\n"
		"  into stable forms.\n"
		"\n"
		"2. Custom rules in RLE format:\n"
		"\n"
		"This format explicitly defines birth (B) and survival (S)\n"
		"conditions.\n"
		"\n"
		"For example:\n"
		"B3/S23   - Classic Conwayâ€™s rule: born with 3 neighbors,\n"
		"           survives with 2 or 3\n"
		"S23/B3   - Same as above (order and case are ignored)\n"
		"B36/S23  - Highlife rule\n"
		"\n"
		"The format is case-insensitive, and B and S can appear in\n"
		"any order.  Digits must range from 0 to 8.\n"
		"\n"
		"A cell is born if it is currently dead and the number of\n"
		"live neighbors matches any of the values listed after 'B'.\n"
		"A cell survives if it is currently alive and the number of\n"
		"live neighbors matches any of the values listed after 'S'.\n"
